        <h2>About Baymax</h2>
        <p>Baymax was conceptualized by Tadashi as a healthcare-providing robot nurse, with a goal to improve healthcare around the world. He was constructed using equipment and funding courtesy of the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. Baymax's artificial intelligence (which was based on a thesis by SFIT alumni, Wendy Wower) comes from a special chip with Tadashi's inscriptions. The chip is equipped with a caregiving matrix, and without it, Baymax can be conceived as an entirely different being. As programming would have, Baymax is instantly summoned by the sound of distress, and can only deactivate once his current patient states, "I am satisfied with my care."</p>

        <h2>Baymax's Personality</h2>
        <p>By design, Baymax is selfless, caring and extremely devoted to his patients. He looks to improve the world's health by any means necessary, and will willingly go to great lengths to achieve his programmed goal. Though highly knowledgable in the medical field, he is slightly na√Øve and childlike. He is rather calm, even in dangerous situations, and is somewhat slow is processes things around him that don't involve health. Baymax is also very curious of his surroundings and tends to get easily distracted. His docile personality comes from a healthcare programming chip created by Tadashi. When installed, Baymax is soft-spoken, calm and attentive. However, his personality and abilities can be altered with other chips; one example being a chip created by Hiro which gave Baymax the ability to fight, but also sent him on a violent rampage without the presence of his original chip.<br><br>Click on the links below to read more:</p>
